Seems cliche to me too. Start writing blogs on your birthday? Pfft. I started journaling on my brothers birthday, and I wrote a total of 10 entries by his next birthday. that's like an average of 36.5 days. And that was only because I stopped writing 6 months in 🤦‍♂️.

I'm bad at continuing habits. That's why I'm reading Atomic Habits by James Clear. The first book i'm reading. Ever! And in that book, he states that the way to build new habits is to Make it obvious, Make it attractive, Make it easy and Make it satisfying. The first tip he gives to make it obvious is to build a habit scorecard. So, I'm currently working on a flutter app to keep score of my habits. By the time I publish this blog, It should be available for download. so check it out.

I guess that's enough for my first piece of writing. Thanks for reading 😁.
